# Conventions Reference

One-stop reference for key decisions baked into this repo's rules and skills. When you adopt this library, these are the paths and conventions your project inherits.

---

## Tech stack

Update this to match your project. The kickoff prompt reads this section to evaluate stack fit.

These are available technology choices per layer, not a mandatory full stack. Each project uses the minimum subset that covers its requirements.

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| BE | Java 21 + Spring Boot (REST API, Spring Data JPA + Hibernate 6, H2 for dev/test, PostgreSQL/MySQL for prod) |
| FE | React 18 + TypeScript (Redux Toolkit, TanStack Query, React Router v6, Vite) |
| Infra | Terraform on AWS |
| QA | Playwright (E2E + API) |

## File locations

Design docs and plans live under `generated-docs/`. Production artifacts (code, migrations, seeds) live under `src/`. Agent-to-agent handoffs always pass the `.md` file only. The `.html` file is for stakeholder and human review.

| Artifact | Path | Owner | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| PRD | `product-specs/prd.md` | PM writes | `senior-product-manager.md` |
| Mocks | `generated-docs/design/` | Designer writes, PM approves | `senior-ux-ui-designer.md` |

| BE Detailed Design | `generated-docs/architecture/be-detailed-design.md` + `generated-docs/architecture/be-detailed-design.html` | BE writes, EM approves | `senior-backend-engineer.md` |
| FE Detailed Design | `generated-docs/architecture/fe-detailed-design.md` + `generated-docs/architecture/fe-detailed-design.html` | FE writes, EM approves | `senior-frontend-engineer.md` |
| API Contract | `generated-docs/contracts/api-contract.md` + `generated-docs/contracts/api-contract.html` | BE + FE write, EM approves | `senior-backend-engineer.md`, `senior-frontend-engineer.md` |
| Test Plan | `generated-docs/qa/test-plan.md` + `generated-docs/qa/test-plan.html` | QA writes, EM approves | `senior-qa-automation-engineer.md` |
| ER Diagram | `src/db/er-diagram.md` | BE writes, EM verifies | `er-diagram-rule.md` |
| DB Schema Files | `src/db/schema/` | BE | `db-schema.md` |
| DB Migrations | `src/db/migrations/` | BE | `db-schema.md` |
| DB Seeds (all envs) | `src/db/seeds/common/` | BE | `db-schema.md` |
| DB Seeds (dev only) | `src/db/seeds/dev/` | BE | `db-schema.md` |
| Infrastructure | `src/infra/` | DevOps | `senior-devops-engineer.md` |
| Tech Debt / Bug Backlog | `BACKLOG.md` | EM triages | `backlog-reporting-rule.md` |
| Delivery Tracker | `workflow/delivery-tracker.md` | Seeded at kickoff; progressively filled by EM | `contract-first-rule.md`, `progress-tracking-rule.md` |

---

## Contract approvals

Agent-to-agent technical contracts that block downstream work until approved. Approval requires a `Status: Approved — [role]` header at the top of the file. Human milestone gates (PRD, Mocks, Sys Arch, Implementation Plan) are defined per-project in `workflow/delivery-tracker.md`.

| Artifact | Approver | Blocks |
|---|---|---|
| PRD | PM | Designer (mocks, flows) |
| DB schema | EM + BE | BE data layer, migrations, queries |
| API contract | EM + BE + FE | BE endpoint implementation, FE integration |

---

## DB conventions

| Convention | Value |
|---|---|
| Migration filename format | `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_<description>.sql` |
| Schema files | Numbered (`01_users.sql`), run once, never modified after first run |
| Column naming | snake_case (e.g. `created_at`, `user_id`, `order_total`) |
| ID type | UUID |
| Audit columns | `id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at` on every table |
| Index naming | `idx_{table}_{column}`, unique: `uq_{table}_{column}` |
| FK naming | `{referenced_table}_id` by default; role-based (e.g. `customer_id`) when two FKs reference the same table |

---

## ER diagram format

Mermaid `erDiagram` syntax. Must be updated in the same commit as any schema change.

---

## Code style

| Convention | Value |
|---|---|
| Linter | Checkstyle with `google_checks.xml` |
| Coverage | 100% line coverage enforced via JaCoCo |
| Maven phase | `verify` -- `mvn verify` fails on Checkstyle violations or coverage below 100% |
| CI gate | GitHub Actions runs `mvn verify` on every PR, blocks merge on failure |

---

## Backlog

All agents append to the Triage table in `BACKLOG.md`. ID and priority are assigned by EM at triage -- never self-assigned.

---

## GitHub issue labels

Flat labels -- no prefixes. Apply one area label and one type label per issue. Priority is added at triage.

**Area:** `be` `fe` `db` `infra` `design` `qa` `spec` `mocks` `contract`

**Type:** `bug` `debt` `ux` `gap`

**Priority:** `p0` `p1` `p2`

Examples: `be` + `bug` = backend defect. `spec` + `gap` = missing requirement. `mocks` + `gap` = missing design coverage.
