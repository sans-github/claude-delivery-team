# Introduction

A collection of reusable, generic Claude Code agent definitions for a software engineering team. Each agent represents a distinct engineering or product role with well-defined expertise, collaboration style, and hard constraints.

See [SETUP-GUIDE.md](.claude/SETUP-GUIDE.md) to install and run your first project.

## Agents

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `senior-engineering-manager` | Owns architecture, delivery planning, API contracts, QA plan, and phase sign-off across all workstreams |
| `senior-product-manager` | Owns PRD and acceptance criteria; defines delivery phases and drives cross-functional alignment |
| `senior-software-architect` | Owns system-wide technical direction, structural integrity, and critical path design review |
| `senior-frontend-engineer` | Builds accessible, performant UI with full ownership of components, state, routing, and API integration (React 18, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Playwright) |
| `senior-backend-engineer` | Designs and implements the full backend stack including DB schema, API, auth, and Terraform infra |
| `senior-devops-engineer` | Owns CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure (IaC), observability stack, and security posture end-to-end |
| `senior-qa-automation-engineer` | Owns full test pipeline including strategy, test files, CI wiring, and quality gates |
| `senior-ux-ui-designer` | Creates distinctive, production-grade interfaces and complete design artifacts |
| `senior-macos-designer` | Creates platform-native macOS interfaces respecting the Human Interface Guidelines, with full ownership of mocks, component specs, dark mode, and menu design |
| `senior-swift-engineer` | Builds SwiftUI-first macOS apps with full ownership of the view layer, architecture, persistence, networking, Xcode project configuration, and App Store delivery |

Agent files live in `.claude/agents/` and are automatically loaded by Claude Code.

## Structure

Each agent definition covers:
- **Qualities** -- role mindset, quality standards, and operating principles
- **Collaboration** -- who this role works with and how
- **Ownership** -- what this role owns end-to-end
- **Decision-making** -- how this role makes and escalates decisions
- **Communication** -- how this role communicates blockers, reviews, and handoffs
- **Hard constraints** -- non-negotiable rules that govern the role
- **Commit conventions** -- role-specific commit rules, inline in the agent file

Collaboration contracts (depends-on, produces, gatekeeps per pair) live in `.claude/skills/collaboration-contracts/SKILL.md` -- the single source of truth for artifact flows. All agents load this skill at runtime.

## Skills

Standalone domain skills live under `.claude/skills/{skill}/`, each with a `SKILL.md`. Agents reference skills in their `skills:` frontmatter. Skills load progressively: frontmatter at startup, body when triggered, referenced files on demand.

Skill names must be unique across all skill files.

Contributor slash commands are also packaged as skills: `/feature-init` (scaffold a new feature), `/feature-init-dry-run` (dry run the full workflow), `/fix-gh-issues` (implement open GitHub issues), and `/create-new-agent` (add a new agent to this repo with full structural verification).

## Collaboration map

Agents collaborate by exchanging artifacts. The Gatekeeper is the role with final say -- they review, raise concerns, and resolve with the owner before downstream work proceeds.

<summary>Step-by-step flow</summary>

1. **User** shares requirements with **PM**.
2. **PM** gathers requirements and produces the PRD and ACs.
3. **PM** sends PRD to **Design**, who creates Mocks. PM reviews and refines jointly with Design.
4. **PM** sends PRD, Reqs, Mocks, and ACs to **EM**. EM is the single intake point for engineering -- no direct PM handoff to BE, FE, QA, or DevOps.
5. **EM** engages **Arch** and collaborates to produce Sys Arch based on PRD and system constraints.
6. **EM** authors Eng Plans (HLD) based on Sys Arch and PRD. Arch contributes; FE and BE align on scope.
7. **EM** kicks off **BE** with HLD, PRD, Reqs, and ACs. BE authors BE Detailed Design and iterates until EM approves.
8. **EM** kicks off **FE** with HLD, PRD, Reqs, ACs, and Mocks. FE authors FE Detailed Design and iterates until EM approves.
9. **FE and BE** jointly author the API Contract, aligned on their Detailed Designs. EM approves before implementation begins.
10. **EM** kicks off **QA** in two waves: first with PRD, Mocks, and ACs (concurrent with BE/FE kickoff) so QA can begin Test Plan authoring; then with approved BE/FE Detailed Designs once available for detailed QA planning. QA iterates the Test Plan with EM until approved.
11. **BE**, **FE**, and **QA** each independently author their own Issues List and submit to **EM** for sign-off.
12. **EM** approves each Issues List. Each role then creates GH Issues and begins implementation.
13. **BE** implements BE Artifacts per BE Detailed Design and API Contract. **FE** implements FE Artifacts per FE Detailed Design and API Contract.
14. **BE** and **FE** each produce Test Docs for QA to use in automation.
15. **QA** authors the automation suite against FE/BE artifacts and test docs. EM approves before delivery.

## Rules

Rules in `.claude/rules/` apply automatically to every session:

- **workflow-phases-rule** -- multi-step work must be defined as a phased workflow with numbered steps, responsible roles, and concrete artifacts
- **progress-tracking-rule** -- `delivery-tracker.md` is the single source of truth for human gates and phase progress; agents check off steps and resume from it directly
- **backlog-reporting-rule** -- append discovered bugs and tech debt to `BACKLOG.md` triage table
- **contract-first-rule** -- governs agent-to-agent technical contracts (HLD, DB Schema, BE Detailed Design, FE Detailed Design, API Contract, Test Plan, Issues Lists); human milestone gates are tracked in `workflow/delivery-tracker.md`
- **db-schema-change-rule** -- all schema changes require a versioned migration file and an updated ER diagram (`src/db/er-diagram.md`) in the same commit; no raw DDL outside migration files
- **product-baseline-rule** -- maintain a consolidated master PRD and mocks at `projects/master/`; PM and Designer are blocked from starting a new feature until it is current

## Usage guide

```bash
bash install.sh          # sync latest
bash install.sh v1.2.0   # pin a tag or branch
```

This clones the upstream repo and overwrites everything under `.claude/` (agents, rules, skills, template, guide docs) except your `settings.json`. Commit the result to lock the version.

Default file locations (e.g. `src/db/er-diagram.md`, `BACKLOG.md`) can be overridden in your project's `CLAUDE.md`. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
